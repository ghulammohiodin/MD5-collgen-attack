this is the md5 collgen attack lab 
Question 1: If the length of your prefix file is not a multiple of 64, what is going to happen?
Answer: It will be padded with zeros

Question 2: Create a prefix file with exactly 64 bytes, and run the collision tool again, and see what happens.
Answer: No zero padding is observed

Question 3. Are the data (128 bytes) generated by md5collgen completely different for the two output files? Please identify all the bytes that are different.
Answer: No, not all bytes are different. In previous case, the bytes only differ at the positions 20, 60, 84 and 110. After multiple trials, it is noted that these differences are not constant.
